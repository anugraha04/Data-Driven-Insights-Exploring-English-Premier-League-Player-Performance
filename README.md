# Data-Driven-Insights-Exploring-English-Premier-League-Player-Performance

English Premier League Players EDA

📌 Project Overview

This project explores player performance in the English Premier League (EPL) using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering. The analysis compares different performance metrics such as goals, assists, defensive contributions, and appearances to uncover insights about player trends and effectiveness.

🔍 Key Features & Analysis

Comparative Performance Analysis – Examined key parameters such as goal contributions, defensive efficiency, and appearances to identify top-performing players.

Feature Engineering – Created new insights by deriving goal contribution ratios, defensive impact scores, and player efficiency indices.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handled missing values, optimized dataset structure, and ensured data integrity for reliable analysis.

Visual Storytelling – Designed Seaborn & Matplotlib visualizations to showcase nationality-based trends, positional effectiveness, and goal distributions.

Insights on Player Nationality & Performance Trends – Analyzed which nationalities contribute the most to goals and appearances in the EPL.

📊 Technologies Used

Python (for data manipulation and analysis)

Pandas (data wrangling & processing)

Seaborn & Matplotlib (data visualization)

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of EPL player statistics up to 2020-09-24.

Includes player details such as nationality, position, appearances, goals, assists, and defensive stats.

🚀 How to Run the Notebook
